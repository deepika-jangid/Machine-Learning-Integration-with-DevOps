# Problem Statement 
Today 90% of the Machine Learning Models does not succeed because of the reason that whenever you change something into the code, after training it, to improve it's performance and accuracy, and if our model is build using BigData then it will take a lot of time, computing power and resources to train our model again and if after then the accuracy does not matches your requirements then you again need to tweak the model and wait for it to again get trained.
